Challenge 2 Portfolio builder 

Our challenge is build a working portfolio to present to possible emplpoyers with links to projects that we have built before hand. The goal of the challenge is to explore further into CSS code, while laying further groundwork on HTML memory.  Once the project is done we would be able to present ourselves in a quick and consices manner to futre clients.  

With this challenge we were given the requirements to start from square one so no base code was given before hand.  We need to have an understanding of CSS/HTML to be able to create the project with only the goal in mind.  

using What projects I have started, I wanted to make a links showcasing run-buddy and robo gladiator.  To have at least 3 "projects" on the screen i will have a dead link that will simply go to no where until I do have a 3rd project that can be added into the portfolio.  

Showcasing my CSS skills I want to try and stick close to the mock up in spirit by having: "about me", "work", and "contact me". I would like to add some difference in layout to add my own taste to the project.
